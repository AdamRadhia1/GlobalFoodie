# GlobalFoodie
Global food search engine:
Global Foodie is designed to help users explore restaurants around the world through an interactive map. The platform allows travelers to visually search for food spots by location, view restaurant information, and access supporting links and images to guide their dining choices.
My project demonstrates cross-domain mapping by integrating geographic mapping (Mapbox) and Google Places, a food-location search system, and user interaction. The map visually plots places on earth, and the restaurant search data connects real-world food locations to geographic coordinates, allowing global exploration. These independent domains—mapping, food/restaurant data, and UI interaction—are merged into one functional system.
